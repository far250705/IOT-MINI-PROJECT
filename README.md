The Smart Plant Watering System is an IoT-based solution aimed at automating the irrigation process to promote efficient water usage and healthy plant growth. With growing concerns about water scarcity and the inefficiencies of manual irrigation, this system offers a sustainable alternative by leveraging real-time environmental data.

At its core, the system uses a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller connected to soil moisture sensors to monitor the moisture level in the soil. When the moisture level drops below a defined threshold, the system automatically activates a water pump via a relay module to irrigate the plant. Once the desired moisture level is reached, the system stops watering to prevent over-irrigation.

The system is connected to the Blynk IoT platform, which allows users to monitor soil conditions and control the system remotely using a mobile application. This integration provides convenience, especially for urban users or individuals with limited time for plant care.

The design supports customization based on the type of plant, environmental conditions, and soil type. It also minimizes water wastage, reduces the need for human intervention, and ensures consistent watering based on actual plant needs rather than fixed schedules.

This project demonstrates the practical application of IoT technology in smart agriculture and home gardening, offering a scalable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly solution to modern irrigation challenges.
